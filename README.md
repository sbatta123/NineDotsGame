# NineDotsGame
CSS Application
a) About how many hours did it take for you to implement this task?
3 hours

b) What was your biggest challenge in implementing this task?
The biggest challenge was getting players to be able to work on the same board.
I struggled with making this part of the game work where players were able work together, 
but was able to display the other player's information and avatar.

c) What was a key design decision you made for this implementation?
I decided to make a canvas and place buttons on top of the canvas to allow users to draw lines.
I did this because in the future I would like to be able to track if their lines hit all the buttons
to determine if they won the game.

d) (If unfinished) What do you plan to implement next?
I was working on getting multiplayer to work, but was not able to finish this task. 
In the future, I would spend some more time ensuring that two players can interact on the same board.
I would like to learn how you can use empirica to accomplish such a task.
